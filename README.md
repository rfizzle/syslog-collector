syslog-collector: Open-Source SysLog Log Collector

[syslog-collector](https://github.com/rfizzle/syslog-collector) is an open-source collector designed to accept syslog data, parse it, and submit to supplied outputs. It provides the ability to export results to a number of different destinations, such as Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Stackdriver, file, and HTTP endpoint.

### Install

Installation of syslog-collector is dead-simple - just download and extract the zip containing the [release for your system](https://github.com/rfizzle/syslog-collector/releases/), and run the binary. syslog-collector has binary releases for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

### Building From Source
**If you are building from source, please note that syslog-collector requires Go v1.13 or above, due to its use of Go Modules!**

To build syslog-collector from source, simply run `go get github.com/rfizzle/syslog-collector` and `cd` into the project source directory. Then, run `go build`. After this, you should have a binary called `syslog-collector` in the current directory.

### Docker
You can also get syslog-collector via the official Docker container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/rfizzle/syslog-collector/).
The collector was built with Kubernetes in mind.
